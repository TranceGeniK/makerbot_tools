This tool will try to automatically set up air print detection. It will try to detect where the artefact is and use that position as reference for future detection. A yellow contour should appear around the artefact which will mean the setting was a success. If that is not the case, please retry.
<div>
Tip: Adding more light to the room or directly pointing a light source (flash-light, lamp...) onto the artefact alone will help the detection greatly.
